### Elevator pitch
Do you love to tell stories? Do you need a place to organize your thoughts? The Character Detail Organizer allows creators to insert character details in an organized fashion. You can create many projetcs with their own set of characters. With the Character Detail Organizer, the only limit on character development is your imagination.
